# ParkingInThessaloniki

This projects solves a problem with a parking space represented by a
M*N grid in which there may be: a) obstacles, b)
cars heading N/S and c) cars heading E/W.
The goal is to empty the parking lot of all cars until
all cells remain empty (except of course those containing obstacles).

A BFS algorithm is also implemented to find the solution with the least
number of car moves.
